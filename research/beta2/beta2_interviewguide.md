**Federalist Interview guide**  
for usability testing in January 2016 / Beta 2  

# Intro

*[7 min. Intro yourself, go through the research goals and what the interview will look like. If they haven't sent in the consent form yet, have them read it over and sign before starting]*  


* **Intro:** Hello! My name is *[your name]*. Thank you for meeting with us. This interview involves two parts. The first part I’ll ask you some questions about your current role, and your experiences with creating websites. The second part is a look at our current design, and I'll guide us through that part. The purpose is to learn about you as someone who might use Federalist. There are absolutely no right or wrong answers. Please, feel comfortable with saying what you really think and how you really feel.


* **Consent form**: Also, thanks for sending along the consent form!


* **Recording:** I'll be recording our conversation. The purpose of this is so that I can get all the details but at the same time be able to stay present with you. I assure you that all your comments will remain confidential. I'll be compiling a report which will contain all participants comments without any reference to individuals. Some of my team members are observing via video stream so that they can hear your valuable insights. Is that ok with you?

* **Github** Just want to double check, do you have a github account? We'll be using that today.

# Website walkthrough

*[20 min. Leave time for getting folks set up and logged into github and Federalist at the beginning.]*

Now I’d like you to take a look at our current design. As we go through it, I'd like you to say what you are thinking out loud. If something surprises or confuses you, please say so! We are here testing how well the website works, *not* your ability to understand it.

### 1: Log in & Landing page

*The first thing we'll do is to sign up on Federalist using Github
basic landing page thoughts / login through github / dashboard pages list


* First, sign into your account on Github.
* Let's go to federalist.18f.gov
* Here we are, can you take look around and tell me what this site is trying to say?
  * *[What does it do, who is it for?  Is it understandable, what's confusing?]*
* Let's log in
* Once logged in, what are we seeing here?
* Let's create a new site
  * And feel free to choose whichever template you'd like



### 2: Making a new page

*Let's say you've created all the pages necessary for your new website, except the Contact Us page. Let's make that page now.*

* What would you do to make this new page?
* Can you add some content to this page?
Create  / image insert / save --



### 3: Editing a page & previewing it (plus publish?)

*Let's say you found a couple of typos [XYZ] page, and you want to correct them.*

Edit a typo / cancel / view preview / preview only true to that page / navigate to another page (which is on production)

* at this point, what would you do to cancel the changes

save + publish / move a page

### 4: Organizing your site

*Let's say you had a meeting with your team, and the follow up of that meeting was to re-organize a couple of pages on the site.*

* Can you please edit the [XYZ] page?

* Can
these two pages subpages
dealing with multiple pages at once / or one at a time / what is the paradigm people are used to and would expect

# Wrap up

* What is your impression of Federalist?
* How would you describe it to someone else?
* How would you characterize it's brand / personality?
* If you had a magic wand, what would Federalist look like and work like for you?




If there is time:

* preview
* how do people want to share? PDF / screenshots / just the copy / live site
Listen for:
How well we've done github abstraction (doesn't matter) > but, is the UI making sense?
* spending money on CMS? Is it successful?
