### Federalist Interview guide  
For usability testing in January 2016 / Beta 2  

# Intro

*[5 min]*

* **Intro:** Hello! My name is [your name]. Thank you for meeting with us. This interview involves two parts. During the first part, I’ll ask you some questions about your current role, and your experiences with creating websites. During the second part, I'd like to hear your thoughts about your current design. The purpose is to learn about you as someone who might use Federalist. There are absolutely no right or wrong answers. Please, feel comfortable with saying what you really think and how you really feel.

* **Consent form**: Also, thanks for sending along the consent form! *[If they haven't sent in the consent form yet, have them read it over and sign before starting]*

* **Recording:** I'll be recording our conversation, so that I can get all the details but at the same time be able to stay present with you. I assure you that all your comments will remain confidential. Some of my team members are observing via video stream so that they can also hear your insights. Is that ok with you?

* **Github** Just want to double check: do you have a github account? We'll be using that today.

# Website walkthrough

*[20 min. Get folks set up and logged into github and Federalist.]*

Now I’d like you to take a look at our current design. As we go through it, I'd like you to say what you are thinking out loud. If something surprises or confuses you, please say so! The most important thing is: we are here testing how well the website works, *not* your ability to understand it. There are no wrong answers!

### Task 1: Log in & Landing page

The first thing we'll do is to sign up on Federalist using Github. We'll go through this part quickly, and if you have any questions I can answer them at the end.

Let's go to https://federalist-test.18f.gov. Can you take look around, and tell me what this site is trying to say?

*[Listen for: What is Federalist?  Who is it for?  Is it understandable? What seems confusing?]*

Please log in, and create a new site, using the third template with the big image. When you finish, let's see what your new looks like. It should take one or two minutes to create your new site.


### 2: Making a new page

You've created all the pages necessary for your new website, except the Contact Us page. Please create that page, and add a title (by typing "title: Contact Us" in the Other settings field.)

Include the following:

"Contact us any time by  email at test@test.gov.
We are available by phone during business hours 877-867-5309."

When you finish, verify that your page was created.

*[We're currently working on making sure there's a field for the page title, but for now, I'd like to you type "title: Contact Us" in the Other settings field.]*

### 3: Editing, previewing and publishing a page

Let's say you want to emphasize certain parts of the About page by making some text bold. Could you please make these changes?

*[In the Pages section, find and navigate to About]*

Let's say for a minute you decided that these changes aren't really working. What would you do?

*[Looking for how people think about going back or canceling]*

When you're finished, what would you do to make sure that the changes work and look good on your live actual site?

*[Looking for how and where people expect to see their changes, and whether it's clear that published pages are the only ones that show up up-to-date when you View your site. The new Contact Us page should be in the Pages list, and for now, users will have to click navigation options and choose "show in menu" to make sure it appears in the menu.  If they can't get to show in menu, ask...]*

Can you tell me what navigation options might mean? What do these options do?


### 4: Organizing your site

Let's say you had a meeting with your team, and the follow up of that meeting was to re-organize a couple of pages on the site. Here are the decisions:

- Contact Us should be a sub-page of About.
- The order of Projects should be: 1) Reducing Summer Melt, 2) Microloans for Farmers

* *[Looking for how well people interact with the drag and drop functionality and What are people are used to and would expect? How do people use the "show in menu" option.]*  

During a follow up, your team discusses that the Projects section needs to be thought about in a completely different way. You and your team come up with new content and are ready to add it to the site. You don't need the current projects. What would you do to take them off the site completely?

* *[Looking for how people use bulk delete for drafts and pages.]*
