### Federalist Interview guide  
For usability testing in January 2016 / Beta 2  

# Intro

*[5 min]*

* **Intro:** Hello! My name is [your name]. Thank you for meeting with us. This interview involves two parts. During the first part, I’ll ask you some questions about your current role, and your experiences with creating websites. During the second part, I'd like to hear your thoughts about your current design. The purpose is to learn about you as someone who might use Federalist. There are absolutely no right or wrong answers. Please, feel comfortable with saying what you really think and how you really feel.

* **Consent form**: Also, thanks for sending along the consent form! *[If they haven't sent in the consent form yet, have them read it over and sign before starting]*

* **Recording:** I'll be recording our conversation, so that I can get all the details but at the same time be able to stay present with you. I assure you that all your comments will remain confidential. Some of my team members are observing via video stream so that they can also hear your insights. Is that ok with you?

* **Github** Just want to double check: do you have a github account? We'll be using that today.

# Website walkthrough

*[20 min. Get folks set up and logged into github and Federalist now.]*

Now I’d like you to take a look at our current design. As we go through it, I'd like you to say what you are thinking out loud. If something surprises or confuses you, please say so! The most important thing is: we are here testing how well the website works, *not* your ability to understand it. There are no wrong answers!

### Task 1: Log in & Landing page

The first thing we'll do is to sign up on Federalist using Github. We'll go through this part quickly, and if you have any questions I can answer them at the end.

Let's go to https://federalist-test.18f.gov. Can you take look around, and tell me what this site is trying to say?

*[Listen for: What is Federalist?  Who is it for?  Is it understandable? What seems confusing?]*

Please log in, and create a new site, using the third template with the big image. When you finish, let's see what your new looks like.

*[It should take one or two minutes to create your new site.]*


### 2: Making a new page

You've created all the pages necessary for your new website, except the Contact Us page. Please create that page and include the following:

"Contact us any time by  email at test@test.gov.
We are available by phone during business hours 877-867-5309."

When you finish, verify that your page was created.


### 3: Editing, previewing and publishing a page

Let's say you want to emphasize certain parts of the index.md page by making some text bold. Could you please make these changes?

Let's say for a minute you decided that these changes aren't really working. What would you do?

*[Looking for how people think about "Cancel"]*

When you're finished, what would you do to make sure that the changes work and look good on the actual site?

*[Looking for how and where people expect to see their changes.]*

———

* Your Contact Us page is looking great. What would you do to make sure it's part of your live / published site?
  * *[Looking for how people understand and think about unpublished vs published pages. ASK: What's the status on this differentiation?]*

### 4: Organizing your site

*Let's say you had a meeting with your team, and the follow up of that meeting was to re-organize a couple of pages on the site.*

* Let's say the Overview page needs to be a section that contains.What would you do make X and Y page subpages of Z page?  
* *[Looking for how people want to organize multiple pages (at once, or one at a time?) What is the paradigm people are used to and would expect?]*  
* *[ASK: What's the status of the pages page?]*
* *[ASK: How do subpages show up in the main menu? Is it a dropdown?]*
bulk edit / delete ?
