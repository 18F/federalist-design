### Federalist Interview guide  
For usability testing in January 2016 / Beta 2  

# Intro

*[5 min]*

* **Intro:** Hello! My name is [your name]. Thank you for meeting with us. This interview involves two parts. During the first part, I’ll ask you some questions about your current role, and your experiences with creating websites. During the second part, I'd like to hear your thoughts about your current design. The purpose is to learn about you as someone who might use Federalist. There are absolutely no right or wrong answers. Please, feel comfortable with saying what you really think and how you really feel.

* **Consent form**: Also, thanks for sending along the consent form! *[If they haven't sent in the consent form yet, have them read it over and sign before starting]*

* **Recording:** I'll be recording our conversation, so that I can get all the details but at the same time be able to stay present with you. I assure you that all your comments will remain confidential. Some of my team members are observing via video stream so that they can also hear your insights. Is that ok with you?

* **Github** Just want to double check: do you have a github account? We'll be using that today.

# Website walkthrough

*[20 min. Get folks set up and logged into github and Federalist now.]*

Now I’d like you to take a look at our current design. As we go through it, I'd like you to say what you are thinking out loud. If something surprises or confuses you, please say so! The most important thing is: we are here testing how well the website works, *not* your ability to understand it. There are no wrong answers!

### Task 1: Log in & Landing page

The first thing we'll do is to sign up on Federalist using Github. We'll go through this part quickly, and if you have any questions I can answer them at the end.

basic landing page thoughts / login through github / dashboard pages list

* [Then] Can you take look around, and tell me what this site is trying to say?
  * *[Listen for: What is Federalist?  Who is it for?  Is it understandable? What seems confusing?]*
* Let's create a new site
  * [Then] Feel free to choose whichever template you'd like
  * Name your site whatever you'd like
  * It should take one or two minutes to create your new site.
* Great! Let's see what your new site looks like.

* Your Contact Us page is looking great. What would you do to make sure it's part of your live / published site?

*Let's say you had a meeting with your team, and the follow up of that meeting was to re-organize a couple of pages on the site.*
