**Federalist Interview guide**  
for usability testing in January 2016 / Beta 2  

# Intro

*[7 min. Intro yourself, go through the research goals and what the interview will look like. If they haven't sent in the consent form yet, have them read it over and sign before starting]*  


* **Intro:** Hello! My name is *[your name]*. Thank you for meeting with us. This interview involves two parts. The first part I’ll ask you some questions about your current role, and your experiences with creating websites. The second part is a look at our current design, and I'll guide us through that part. The purpose is to learn about you as someone who might use Federalist. There are absolutely no right or wrong answers. Please, feel comfortable with saying what you really think and how you really feel.


* **Consent form**: Also, thanks for sending along the consent form!


* **Recording:** I'll be recording our conversation. The purpose of this is so that I can get all the details but at the same time be able to stay present with you. I assure you that all your comments will remain confidential. I'll be compiling a report which will contain all participants comments without any reference to individuals. Some of my team members are observing via video stream so that they can hear your valuable insights. Is that ok with you?

* **Github** Just want to double check, do you have a github account? We'll be using that today.

# Website walkthrough

*[20 min. Leave time for getting folks set up and logged into github and Federalist at the beginning.]*

Now I’d like you to take a look at our current design. As we go through it, I'd like you to say what you are thinking out loud. If something surprises or confuses you, please say so! We are here testing how well the website works, *not* your ability to understand it.

### 1: Log in & Landing page

*The first thing we'll do is to sign up on Federalist using Github. You'll notice we'll go through this part quickly, and if you have any questions I can answer them at the end.*

  * *[What does it do, who is it for?  Is it understandable, what's confusing?]*
* Let's sign up to Federalist
* Once signed in, what are we seeing here?
* Let's create a new site
  * And feel free to choose whichever template you'd like
  * Name your site whatever you'd like

  * *[Looking for how and where people expect to see their changes. ASK: Can you preview from the page itself? Or do you need to go back to the pages view to preview the entire site?]*  
* Your Contact Us page is looking great. What would you do to make sure it's part of your live / published site?
  * *[Looking for how people understand and think about unpublished vs published pages. ASK: What's the status on this differentiation?]*

### 4: Organizing your site

* What would you do make X and Y page subpages of Z page?
