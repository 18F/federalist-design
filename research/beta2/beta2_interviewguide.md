**Federalist Interview guide**  
For usability testing in January 2016 / Beta 2  

# Intro


* **Intro:** Hello! My name is [your name]. Thank you for meeting with us. This interview involves two parts. The first part I’ll ask you some questions about your current role, and your experiences with creating websites. The second part is a look at our current design, and I'll guide us through that part. The purpose is to learn about you as someone who might use Federalist. There are absolutely no right or wrong answers. Please, feel comfortable with saying what you really think and how you really feel.


* **Consent form**: Also, thanks for sending along the consent form!
  * *[If they haven't sent it yet, have them read it over and sign before starting]*  


* **Recording:** I'll be video-recording our conversation. The purpose of this is so that I can get all the details but at the same time be able to stay present with you. I assure you that all your comments will remain confidential. I will be compiling a report which will contain all participants comments without any reference to individuals. Some of my team members are observing via video stream so that they can hear your valuable insights. Is that ok with you?

# Website walkthrough

Now I’d like you to take a look at our current design. As we go through it, I'd like you to try and say what you are thinking out loud. If something surprises or confuses you, please say so! We are here testing how well the website works, *not* your ability to understand it.

### 1: Log in & Landing page

basic landing page thoughts / login through github / dashboard pages list

* Go to federalist.18f.gov
* Here we are, can you take look around and tell me what this site is trying to say?
  * *What does it do, who is it for?  Is it understandable, what's confusing?*
* Let's log in
* Once logged in, what are we seeing here?
* Looks like you are currently managing and editing one site at work

### 2: Making a new page

*Let's say you've created all the pages necessary for your new website, except the Contact Us page. Let's make that page now.*

* What would you do to make this new page?
* Can you add some content to this page?
Create  / image insert / save --



### 3: Editing a page & previewing it (plus publish?)

*Let's say you found a couple of typos [XYZ] page, and you want to correct them.*

Edit a typo / cancel / view preview / preview only true to that page / navigate to another page (which is on production)

* at this point, what would you do to cancel the changes

save + publish / move a page

### 4: Organizing your site

*Let's say you had a meeting with your team, and the follow up of that meeting was to re-organize a couple of pages on the site.*

* Can you please edit the [XYZ] page?

* Can
these two pages subpages
dealing with multiple pages at once / or one at a time / what is the paradigm people are used to and would expect

# Wrap up

* What is your impression of Federalist?
* How would you describe it to someone else?
* How would you characterize it's brand / personality?





If there is time:

* preview
* how do people want to share? PDF / screenshots / just the copy / live site
* github abstraction (doesn't matter) > but, is the UI making sense?
* spending money on CMS? Is it successful?
