Subject line: Help improve Federalist, open source web publishing platform

Greetings!

[Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/) is an open source web publishing platform for the U.S. federal government. It provides templates for websites, an online editor for maintaining content, and cloud-based infrastructure for high-scale, low-cost website hosting. The team at [18F](18f.gsa.gov) builds and maintains it as a hosted service available to federal government agencies.

**How can you help?** We're looking for volunteers! We’d like to show you some of our work-in-progress and have you try and use it to see if it works for you. You don't need any special tech or subject-matter experience. All you need is a willingness to chat with our team's researchers for about 45 minutes.

**Email me to volunteer** and have an important impact on Federalist.

Thank you for your time!    
Meghana, and the Federalist team


##  No, don’t schedule an interview

Subject line: Re: Help improve Federalist, open source web publishing platform

Hi ______ ,

I appreciate you getting back to me, and letting me know that you’re not available to chat with us right now. If you change your mind in the future, just email me again and we'll include you in our future conversations!

Cheers,  
Meghana, and the Federalist team


## Yes, schedule an interview

Subject line: Scheduling your Federalist chat

Hello  ______ ,

Thank you for volunteering to take a look at some new features we're working on! Thanks so much, the team and I really appreciate it!

What does your [day] look like? I'd love to schedule you for a video chat, if you're willing. Take a look at this calendar and select any of the slots that work for you; if none of the times work (or if they are all gone), totally understandable; we can try for next week too, just shoot me a reply and I'll keep you on the list.

Also, here's a link to our [standard research consent form](https://github.com/18F/federalist-design/blob/master/research/Federalist_ResearchParticipantConsentForm.pdf). If you are able to participate and successfully schedule a time slot, please sign (digital signature is fine) and send it back to us prior to the interview.

Finally, we are completely willing to use the screen-sharing app of your choice, but if you don't have a preference let’s use talky.io, which requires Google Chrome or Firefox.

Thank you!  
Meghana, and the Federalist team

P.P.S, when we start the screen sharing, it will require us to install an extension that allows the browser access to your screen. Don't worry, I'll walk you through that part.


## Interview Confirmation

Hi  ______ , Thanks for signing up for a time to check out Federalist features!

We'll meet at:
[talk.io](https://talky.io/).

If your computer doesn't have a microphone, reply to this and we'll make alternative arrangements. Also, please, if you haven't yet, please fill out the [consent form](https://github.com/18F/federalist-design/blob/master/research/Federalist_ResearchParticipantConsentForm.pdfÂ) that we linked to earlier.

Cheers,  
Meghana, and the Federalist team


## Post-interview thank you

Subject line: Thanks for helping Federalist improve its website!

Hi ______ ,

Thanks again for taking the time out of your day to help us improve the Federalist website. Your input is extremely valuable as we work to make our website clear and easy to understand!

We’re always looking for people to talk to. If you know anyone else who might be willing to spare 45 minutes, please send me their contact information and I will reach out.

Best,  
Meghana, and the Federalist team
