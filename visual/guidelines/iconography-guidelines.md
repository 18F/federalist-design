# Iconography Guidelines

**Design Principles**

The icons are simple, modern, friendly, and intuitive. Each icon is reduced to its minimal form, with every idea edited to its essence. The designs ensure readability and clarity even at small sizes.

Symmetry and consistency of geometric shapes give the icons a unique quality, while keeping them simple and bold. Simple elements unify icons and systemize their placement on the grid. Positioning, sizing, and coloring distinguish between icons.

**Grid**

The 24x24 pixel grid has been developed to facilitate consistency and establish a clear set of rules for the positioning of graphic elements. This standardization results in a flexible but coherent system. 

# Corners and Stroke Caps

Consistent corner radiuses are key to unifying the overall icon family. A 0.5 Unit grid corner radius is used on the corners and caps of the strokes. 

# Strokes

Consistent stroke weights are key to unify- ing the overall icon family. Maintain a pixel unit grid width for all stroke instances. 

#Optical Corrections

If an icon becomes unrecognizable, for example, when it’s filled in, add legibility by using a heavier stroke.

# Variations

If you’re designing an icon that has two versions—one for default and one for active—the active appearance is often filled in, but some designs might call for variations.

Not all actions need an icon. You can use text to represent items in the application. To help you decide whether to use text or icons, consider how many icons are visible onscreen at a time. Too many icons on a screen can make an application seem difficult to use. 

# Final Note

This is just a guideline and not a set of strict rules to follow. Always use your best judgment.
